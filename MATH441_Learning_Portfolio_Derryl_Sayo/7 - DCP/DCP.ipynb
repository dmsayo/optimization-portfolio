        "Convex optimization problems are a superset of problems involving linear programming, integer programming, and quadratic programming which is why these can all be solved by CVXPY.

        "One very important and handy property of convex problems is that **all local optimum are also _global_ optimum** which we have experienced empirically through LP and QP problems. There is less of a worry to verify the global optimality of convex optimization solutions as any solution is the best.\n",

        "Convex optimization is the set of problems that requires convex objective and contraint functions. In order to verify the feasibility of the problem, convex optimization packages such as CVXPY leverage the properties of convex functions to determine whether it follows a set of rules. Although there is much more going on in the backend to verify function convexity (eg. all of the CVXPY built in functions are documented with curvature and signs), it follows the structured nature derived from the mathematical definitions of convexity.\n",
