        "The problem statement for a _chessboard puzzle_ (or more specifically _chessboard non-attacking puzzles_) is as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "> Given a large number of non-pawn chess pieces (rook, bishop, knight, queen, king) of a single type and none of the others, how do we place the **maximum** number of pieces such that **no capturing can occur** if the pieces are played legally according to the standard rules of chess\n",
        "\n",
        "This entry aims to summarize, comment, and implement some of the methods described in \"An Application of Graph Theory and Integer Programming: Chessboard Non-Attacking Puzzles\" [see @IP_chess_puzzles] to better understand how we can mathematically model this family of problems to find exact solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why is this Problem \"Hard\"?\n",
        "\n",
        "Although the premise is very simple once you understand the movement rules of each piece, a non-trivial question would be \"how many **distinct ways** are there to place n-queens\"?\n",
        "In particular, the space of possible placements is enormous. Even for the 8-queens problem on an $8 \\times 8$ board, there are a total of \n",

        "$$\n",
        "\\binom{64}{8} = 4,426,165,368\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "positions with only **92** possible solutions. If you simply try all possible placements and then verify they work, it is too computationally expensive for a brute force search. There are some shortcuts \n",
        "to reduce the search space such as using the fact that we can only place a single queen in each column (reduces the 8-queens possibilities to $8^8 = 16,777,216$) but this is still exponentially growing and reaches the limits of\n",
        "a standard computer's computational power very quickly. For example, the search space under this assumption for the 13-queens problem is $13^{13}$ possibilities or\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "13^{13} = 3.0287511 \\times 10^{14}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Although we won't be writing the code to return the total number of solutions, it is worth noting the difficulty of finding solutions for larger chess boards.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Solutions using Integer Programming\n",
        "Our objective is to **place** (ie. **assign**) chess pieces to locations on a chess board such that they do not attack each other **constrained by the legal attacking moves of chess**.\n",
        "\n",
        "This can be recognized as a canonical LP assignment problem with chess specific constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although the paper seeks to build up the problem from the basic principles of linear programming and matrix properties, I found that there is a gap of information missing in explaining how the problem is intuitively formulated mathematically if I wasn't already familiar with the canonical formulation of the problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "Below, we will walk through the intuition on formulating any problem which involves placing things into a finite space under certain restrictions as an assignment IP problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Decision Variables\n",

        "Before even considering how the matrix will look, we know that a chess board is a perfect square and can be uniquely indexed by a row $i$ and a column $j$. For each of these coordinates $(i,j)$, we want to place some value (let's say 1)  if a piece is placed there and another value (let's say 0) if a piece is not placed there.\n",

        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "This binary decision variable formulation is quite powerful. Routing problem solutions use this idea as well by asking \"should I take this road or not?\" and the knapsack problem makes decisions based on \"should I take this item or not?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "### Objective Function\n",
        "Our goal to solve the chessboard puzzle is to fit **as many** of the specified piece on an $n \\times n$ chess board. In mathematical terms we want to **maximize** the total number of assigned pieces:\n",
        "\n",

        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Although in this case we are unconstraining the number of pieces and letting the algorithm decide, some problems wish to simply find a feasible solution and can be represented by the objective function:\n",

        "\\max 1\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "### Constraints\n",
        "We will formulate the constraints for the $n$-queens problem. To find a feasible solution, we must satisfy the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Decision variables $x_{ij}$ cannot be assigned a negative value (ie. must be assigned 0 or 1) \n",
        "2. Only a single queen can exist in each row, column, and diagonal\n",

        "The flavor of the second constraint is often found in assignment problems and follows from the design of the decision variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "The rows and columns constraint is quite intuitive since a chess grid can be visualized easily. The idea is as follows for the rows: Consider _only_ a single row $i$. Then, we want to look at every column in that row and count how many assignment occurences are found. Since we know that the variables can only take two values, the assignment will be _unique_ if it ends up summing to 1. Thus:\n",

Summing each $i + j$, we see that this diagonal has \"level\" $k = 2$. The largest \"level\" will include the coordinate $(n - 1, n -2)$ for level $k = 2n - 3$.
