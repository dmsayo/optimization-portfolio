        "The Network Flow problem involves finding the **cheapest** way to send some set of supply sources through a collection of paths with set costs to reach some set of demand sinks.\n",

        "### Adding Congestion Costs\n",
        "In real-life scenarios, however, we are limited by physics, city zoning, etc. which can impact the amount we can transport over a single wire/road/path. The question we will answer and analyze below is how do we represent this mathematically and how different are the solutions when we add congestion built into our mathematical network flow model?\n",

If $b_i < 0$, we consider this node to be a \"supplier\"/source where the flow will originate from. If $b_i > 0$ these are \"consumers\"/sinks where the flow should end.

        "## Conclusion and Analysis of Results\n",
        "As seen in the above, adding the congestion term works in spreading out the flow load around a larger subset of the edges (also depending on the network transportation costs). There could be many uses for adding congestion costs in order to spread out the flow along more edges. For example, packet delivery in an internet network is sensitive to congestion enough to add specific protocols to add mechanisms to control the entry of packets into the network. This could help give a more realistic analysis on packet flow as to not overwhelm the network.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another interesting lesson this can teach us is about the **design** of optimization problems. This congestion term adds a more \"soft constraint\" similar to regularization terms (eg. $\\max f(x) - \\lambda g(x)$ where $\\lambda g(x)$ is a penalty) to make sure that the problem is able to consider \"warnings\" rather than restricting it using explicit constraints. For example, there is nothing restricting the feasibility of sending a lot of data through a single link, but there might be other concerns with slowing down the network if it does happen.\n",
