        "Graph coloring is the classifcation of problems where we assign color labels to elements of a graph under certain constraints [@wikipedia-gc].\n",
        "\n",
        "A common variation is **vertex coloring** in which we assign colors to each vertex in the graph with no adjacent vertices being the same color.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Some Graph Terminology\n",
        "- Let $V$ be the set of vertices/nodes.\n",
        "- Let $E \\subset \\{ (x,y) \\ | \\ x,y \\in V, x \\neq y \\}$ be the set of edges. An edge exists between two distinct vertices and the set of edges can include any number of the possible pairs of vertices. We can represent these as tuples of vertices $(x,y) \\in E$.\n",
        "- Then, let $G  = (V,E)$ be a graph. A graph can be represented (ie. drawn) using only the set of edges/vertices.\n",
        "- $|A|$ is the cardinality of set $A$ which is the number of elements in the set.\n",
        "\n",

If we want to see if a certain coloring is feasible, we could limit $j$ to some target value but for the purposes of this demonstration and a reasonable limit is to set let $j = 0, \\dots, |V| - 1$ as well. In short, we are stating that the worst-case that the algorithm will be able to spit out is if each vertex is colored a separate color. This is a reasonable assumption when you consider graph coloring solutions to the assignment problem (eg. exam assignment); the easiest way to make all exams have no conflict with each other is to simply schedule each on seaparate days.\n",
