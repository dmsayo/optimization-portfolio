        "## Game Theory\n",
        "In general, game theory is the study of mathematical models representing the interactions between agents (whether that be a person, animal, computer program, government, etc.) who aims to perform the most optimal action given the circumstances [see @wikipedia-game_theory].\n",
        "\n",
        "The study of game theory can be applied to analyzing simple games such as Rock-Paper-Scissors to extending into the study of cooperation among living organisms (as seen in [@evo-coop]).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Zero-Sum Matrix Games\n",
        "One specific form of game that is analyzed is the \"zero-sum\" game.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider the situation in which player 1 (P1) and player 2 (P2) each choose from a finite set of stretegies and play a game such that P1 wins.\n",
        "This results in in P1 gaining some amount $c$ and P2 losing that same amount $-c$, whether that be money, points, or some other notion of \"utility\".\n",
        "Then, for each intersection of each of the choices, the net gain/loss is equal to zero such that the entire game's sum of gains/losses is zero as well (hence \"zero-sum\").\n",
        "\n",
        "In other words, zero-sum games are scenarios in which one player gains some amount and the other loses that same amount.\n",
        "\n",
        "Zero-sum games are played in the following manner:\n",
        "\n",
        "- P1 will choice some action available to them secretly and P2 will choice some action available to them independently secretly. Let's say that these actions are chosen at the exact same time and neither player can react to the other's choice until the game is played and resolved.\n",
        "- Then, each choice is revealed and the points are awarded based on the pre-defined outcome of each player choosing their strategy.\n",
        "\n",
        "We say that P1 will choose some row $i \\in 1, \\dots, m$ and P2 will choose some column $j \\in 1, \\dots, n$ and the payoff to P1 is the intersection $a_{ij}$ in an $m \\times n$ payoff matrix $A$. \n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "So, a zero-sum game can be summarized as a single matrix:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",
        "A = \n",
        "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
        "a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} \\\\\n",
        "a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} \\\\\n",
        "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "(Note that there are representations in which the payouts for both players are written as $(x, y)$ where $x$ is the payoff to P1 and $y$ is the payout to P2, but in zero-sum games it is implied that $y = -x$ so we could omit the P2 payoff as seen above.)\n",
        "\n",
        "Another important aspect of zero-sum games is that the choice of strategy does not have to be picking a single row/col deterministically (ie. play with a \"pure\" strategy) and there exists the notion of playing with a \"mixed\" strategy where the choice is based on a probability distribution among the possibilities for each player.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, the \"optimal\" strategy for each player is to maximize their points but for every singular choice there may be a choice that the other player can make that could reduce your payout. So how should we decide which strategy, pure or mixed, to play to maximize the point gains for both players?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Nash Equilibrium, Minimax, and Solving Zero-Sum Games \n",
        "If both players play optimally, intuitively there should be some point in which both players are satisfied with the gain/loss outcome.\n",
        "\n",
        "Consider the game represented as a matrix from P1's perspective. Consider the scenario where P1 picks some strategy and then P2 counters. For any strategy, P1 wants to maximize their payoff but P2 wants to respond by minmizing their own loss. To mitigate the worst case of gaining the least payoff, P1 wants to maximize their minimum gain over all strategies. Using such a strategy implies that they will always make at least this amount.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the inverse scenario, P2 picks some strategy and P1 responds. P2 wants to minimize their loss but P1 wants to respond with the move that gains them the most. The worst case that P2 wants to mitigate is that P1 will pick the response to maximize P2's loss, so P2 wants to try to minimize the maximum loss. Finding the strategy that mins the max loss implies that using this strategy, P2 will always lose at most this amount.\n",
        "\n",
        "Together, these two \"safety strategies\" to mitigate the worst case for each player eventually intersect into what is known as a \"Nash Equilibrium\". Consequently, we get the result that both strategies are optimal responses to each other and there is no incentive to switch since no more value can be gained/lost by switching.\n",
        "\n",
        "In particular, this is point and value is defined and proven in John van Neumann's minimax theorem which states over the set of all (potentially mixed) strategies for P1 $\\Delta^m$ (ie. a vector of length $m$ that represents probability of each row which sums to 1) and all (potentially mixed) strategies for P2 $\\Delta^n$ and a game $A$,\n",
        "\n",
        "$$\n",

        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "for a game value of $x^TAy$.\n",
        "\n",
        "So for two player zero-sum games, if we find the pair of strategies that result in a Nash Equilibrium then we will know exactly how much is lost/gained worst case for each player and the game is considered \"solved\" since there will be no incentive for each player to switch strategies against the opponent who is playing optimally.\n",
        "\n",

There is a mechanic in Smash in which a player can \"tech\" when hitting the ground while in the \"hitstun\" state after getting attacked to remain invulnerable while moving left, right, or stay in-place. A player can also mistime the input and \"miss\" their tech which leaves them vulnerable and have to perform a slow standing animation.
